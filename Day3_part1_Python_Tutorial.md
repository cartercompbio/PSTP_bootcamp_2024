## Introduction

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language with many applications. This tutorial covers the basics that every Python programmer should know.

## Variables and Data Types

### Variables

In Python, a variable is a container for storing data values.

```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```

### Data Types

Python has various data types including integers, floats (decimal numbers), strings, booleans, and more.

```python
integer = 10
floating_point = 10.5
string = "Python"
boolean = True
```

## Control Structures

### If Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### For Loop

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, etc.).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### While Loop

The `while` loop allows you to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

## Functions

A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Alice")
```

## Input and Output

### Input

To get input from the user in Python, you can use the `input()` function.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

### Output

Use the `print()` function to output data to the standard output device.

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've covered the basics of Python programming. Continue practicing to enhance your understanding and skills.
