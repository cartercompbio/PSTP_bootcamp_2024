# High-Performance Cluster (TSCC) Usage Guide

## Introduction

This guide is designed to help students efficiently utilize Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC) for their computational needs.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Cluster

1. Ensure you have an active account. Ask the TA's for your username. Your password will be your active directory password. You will be asked to authenticate with DUO.
2. Connect to the cluster using SSH (Secure Shell):
    For Windows users, install the application MobaXTerm to use SSH.
    hostname = login.tscc.sdsc.edu
    username = ask the TAs

    For those using command line (mac, linux) ssh:
    - ssh yourUsername@login.tscc.sdsc.edu
