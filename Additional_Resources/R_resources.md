# R Language Resources
Here is a compliation of quick reference sheets as well as more complete reference books that may be useful in your R journey. Though tools like ChatGPT can be a helpful coding resources, having a general overview of what kind of functionality is available can greatly expand your options as you run start working on your own analyses.

## Quick Reference Sheets:

### General

* [Base R](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)
* [Statistical Cheat Sheet](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/programming-web-design/r/statistical-analysis-with-r-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-262959/)
* [Guide to R Studio](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html)

### Data Cleaning

* [Importing Data in Tidyverse](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-import.html): Import data from files, databases, json, web APIs, and more
* [Data Transformation (dplyr)](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html): Select, filter, create new columns, and summary statistics
* [Data Transformation: Reshaping Data (tidyr)](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/tidyr.html): Deal with nested data, flip data from wide to long, etc
* [String Manipulation (stringr)](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/strings.html)
* [Date and Time Data (lubridate)](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/lubridate.html)
 
### Data Visualizations
* [Data Visualization with ggplot2](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html)
* [Markdown Documents in R](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html)

Posit also has a variety of other cheat sheets (using Keras for Machine learning, Connecting to Apache Spark with R, Shiny for dashboard development, etc). I just listed the ones I found most relevant here

## Reference Books

### General Analysis

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), solid intro to basic R tasks commonly used in data science including data wrangling and modeling
- [Modern Data Visualization in R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/index.html): great resource for many different kinds of graphs and how to visualize different datatypes
- [Mixed Models](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/introduction.html)

### More Advanced Concepts

- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), the nitty-gritty of objects, particularly useful if you are coming from a different programing language background
- [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/): Building Packages in R, but also a great resource for unit testing in R
- [Efficient Programing in R](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/): Great resource for benchmarking, vectorization, and caching
- Also books in the [Chapman and Hall series](https://www.routledge.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER) covering many other specific topics

## Other Useful Links
* [CHOOSING THE CORRECT STATISTICAL TEST IN SAS, STATA, SPSS AND R](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/): Includes a table with number of variables, variable type, etc. As well as links to an example of the code in R and other languages.

* [What Statistical Test Should I Use? Flowchart](https://statsandr.com/blog/what-statistical-test-should-i-do/): More visual way to view some of the same information (there are many other flowcharts available online if you don't like this one.)
